class Neighbor:
    """
    This new version of the Neighbor class allows for compatiability with the old format with relatively few issues,
    while also providing more secure updates to the neighbors.txt data files.
    The secure_sync wrapper pulls a Neighbor's most recent data, runs the wrapped function,
    and pushes the updated Neighbor back to the text file. This ensures that we don't have to worry
    about pulling or pushing a Neighbor when updating it outside of this class.
    
    A Neighbor object, perhaps instantiated with `neighbor = Neighbor(691338084444274728)`, essentially
    acts as a link between a discord member and their information stored in the neighbors text files.
    
    Functions can then be run on this Neighbor, `neighbor.increment_XP()`, and the necessary file updates are
    automatically made for us.
    
    When updating or accessing several Neighbors at once, it can be useful to use 
    read_all_neighbors() and write_all_neighbors() in conjunction with one another. 
    
    First, use read_all_neighbors() to obtain a list of all neighbors and their information. 
    After any edits to these objects that need to be saved, use write_all_neighbors() and pass it a list of all of the 
    Neighbor objects. The Neighbor objects returned by read_all_neighbors() will not automatically have edits saved to the data files.
    The advantages of this method include: fewer data-file updates when editing many Neighbors at once, and the ability to alter 
    the order in which the Neighbors appear in the file.
